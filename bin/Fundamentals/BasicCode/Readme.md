# Introduction to Java

Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It was developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle) and first released in 1995. Java is known for its portability across platforms, thanks to its "write once, run anywhere" (WORA) capability. This means that code written in Java can run on any device that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed.

Java is widely used for building web applications, mobile applications (especially Android apps), enterprise-level applications, and more. Its syntax is similar to C++, making it relatively easy to learn for those who have experience with other C-based languages.

# Java Basics

## Variables

**What are variables?**  
Containers for storing data values.

**Declaring a variable:**  
`data_type variable_name;`

**Assigning a value:**  
`variable_name = value;`

**Data types:**
- `int` (for integers)
- `double` (for decimal numbers)
- `char` (for single characters)
- `boolean` (for true/false values)
- `String` (for text)

## Operators

**Arithmetic operators:**
- `+` (addition)
- `-` (subtraction)
- `*` (multiplication)
- `/` (division)
- `%` (modulo - remainder)

**Comparison operators:**
- `==` (equal to)
- `!=` (not equal to)
- `>` (greater than)
- `<` (less than)
- `>=` (greater than or equal to)
- `<=` (less than or equal to)

**Logical operators:**
- `&&` (and)
- `||` (or)
- `!` (not)

## Input and Output

**Input:**
- `Scanner` class for reading user input.

**Output:**
- `System.out.println()` for printing to the console.

## Control Flow

**Conditional statements:**
- `if`, `else if`, `else` for decision making.

**Loops:**
- `for` loop for repeating a block of code a specific number of times.
- `while` loop for repeating a block of code as long as a condition is true.
- `do-while` loop for executing a block of code at least once, then repeating as long as a condition is true.

## Other Basic Concepts

**Methods:**
- Reusable blocks of code.

**Arrays:**
- Collections of elements of the same data type.

**Classes and Objects:**
- Building blocks of object-oriented programming.
